#Example
table1
table2
table3
table4a
table4b

#Tidy data = 
#all variables have theior own column
#all observations have their own rows
#all values have their own cell

#Gather Function - When one Variable is spread across multiple columns
table4a
table4a %>%
    gather('1999','2000', key = "Year", value = "Cases")

#Spreading - When a variable is spread across multiple rows
table2
table2 %>% 
    spread(key = type, value = count)

#Gather makes Wide tables longer and thinner
#Spread makes long tables wider and shorter

#Seperate and unite
table3

#Seperate splits one column into two
table3 %>%
  separate(rate, into = c("cases","population"), convert = TRUE, sep = "/")

#Unite Combines Multiple Columns into one column
table5 
unite(table5, new, century, year)
